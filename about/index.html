    <div class="entry-content"><h1>tl;dr</h1>

<p>I am a Software Engineer at <a href="http://www.joyent.com">Joyent</a>, maintain a few
popular open source libraries, and I live in Seattle.  I also play banjo; in
fact for a while I almost just did that instead of technology.  But it turns out
playing banjo for a living is a good way to starve, so I went back to sofware
with a renewed focus, and got versed in distributed systems.  That&rsquo;s mostly what
this blog will be about, btw.</p>

<h1>My history, in what is likely too many words</h1>

<h2>Education</h2>

<p>I went to university at <a href="http://www.psu.edu">Penn State</a>, long before the absurd
scandals.  I grew up in Pennsylvania, and almost went to
<a href="http://www.drexel.edu">Drexel</a>, but I really didn&rsquo;t want to live in
Philadelphia.  That&rsquo;s pretty much that.  Oh, I did a co-op at
<a href="http://www.nortel.com">Nortel</a> before the dot com explosion.</p>

<h2>Career</h2>

<h3>IBM</h3>

<p>My first job was at <a href="http://www.ibm.com">IBM</a> in Austin, where I worked on their
<a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/us/en/directory-server">LDAP Server</a>.
I learned a ton, and actually really liked the first couple years.  But then IBM
&ldquo;offshored&rdquo; most of it, and while I was surprised at how good our replacements
were, this taught me three things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Never outsource your core competency. in this case, being a software product,
software engineering, but this is true of anything, IMO.</li>
<li>If something sucks, and you can&rsquo;t change it, just bail, and do it fast.  Don&rsquo;t
be the last rat off the ship.</li>
<li>(ending on a positive note), change is often good, even when it&rsquo;s forced
change, and it doesn&rsquo;t seem like it at the time.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Amazon (AWS)</h3>

<p>I looked around in Austin for a different job for a while before I finally gave
up and looked elsewhere.  This was sometime in 2006, and
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com">AWS</a> had come out with S3 and <em>just</em> came out with EC2.
From 5m of looking at it I knew this was going to be a big deal; I applied to
AWS, got an offer and moved across the country to Seattle.  I worked there for 4
years, and had a major role in launching a bunch of stuff, but the peak (for me)
was creating and launching the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam">IAM</a> product.</p>

<p>I actually really liked it (except for on-call; that was horrible), learned a
lot, and did some cool stuff.  I ultimately left because the org got big and
political, and I just wanted to do something different.  However, I am now left
with a bitter taste of it as I was harassed for non-compete by AWS lawyers.
Apparently this happens to anybody &ldquo;important&rdquo; that works there and leaves.</p>

<h3>Joyent</h3>

<p>So I went to Joyent, initially because I was hot on
<a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a>.  I had been talking with
<a href="http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc">Bryan</a> for months about going over there, and it
seemed like taking a swing at a PaaS for Node would be pretty awesome.
Ironically I didn&rsquo;t do that at all (but we built something way cooler&hellip;). I got
some initial fame (and legal harassement) for shipping
<a href="http://ldapjs.org">ldapjs</a> &ndash; I finally got the remnants of LDAP out of my
system from what I wanted to do at IBM (which was decouple it).  Really though
my most lasting and popular open source project has been
<a href="http://mcavage.github.com/node-restify">restify</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, fast forward to 2013, and we finally
<a href="http://www.joyent.com/blog/hello-manta-bringing-unix-to-big-data">launched</a>
<a href="https://www.joyent.com/products/manta">Manta</a>.  Manta to me is certainly the
pinnacle of my career, and I think this sort of product is only possible in a
&ldquo;full stack&rdquo; engineering shop.  We basically designed everything from the metal
to the REST API, and while it&rsquo;s still nascent, I really believe this changes the
way people can think about the cloud.</p>

<h1>Other Stuff</h1>

<p>As I said at the top, really I&rsquo;m a musician at heart.  For a while, I ran the
now defunct <em>Music Moose</em>, which was high-quality free music lessons.
Unfortunately I based the whole site on
<a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/revver?ref=Guzels.TV">Revver</a> in an effort to
pay artists for advertising traffic.  There&rsquo;s still some straggler lessons
available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/musicmoosedotorg">YouTube</a>, if you&rsquo;re
so inclined.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been playing &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; banjo for about 15 years now, which I learned
from my uncle <a href="http://davidcavage.blogspot.com">David</a>, who is probably the best
all around banjo player I&rsquo;ve ever heard.  I actually started playing banjo
because I was bored, and David always played.  I just fell in love with the
banjo though, and barely did high school or the first couple years of college
because I was playing all the time.  I also was fortunate enough to be really
good friends with <a href="http://www.ryancavanaughbanjo.com">Ryan Cavanaugh</a>, who is
without doubt the premier banjo player in the world now. We were about the same
age and taught each other a bunch of jazz stuff that traditional banjo players
hate.  I was in several small-time and short-lived bands, but had a decent
amount of regional success in the
<a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/music/2004-11-05/236020">Grassy Knoll Boys</a>.  We
even cut a fairly well-sold record
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Buckeyed-Rabbit-Grassy-Knoll-Boys/dp/B000E5LFNW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373044414&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=buckeyed+rabbit">Buckeyed Rabbit</a>.
Don&rsquo;t buy that; it&rsquo;s free on Spotify et al, and I&rsquo;m not even sure where the
money goes now (I think to record label heaven).</p>

<p>Somewhere along the way I taught myself to play guitar, and I picked up a bunch
of styles from bluegrass (obviously) to blues, jazz, rock, etc.; now I sort
bounce back and forth a lot between banjo and guitar.  This is relevant as my
new quest is Gypsy jazz guitar, which is kind of like starting over for me,
because the right hand is so different than &ldquo;normal&rdquo; guitar.  But it&rsquo;s coming
along.  I&rsquo;ll post some stuff about this when I don&rsquo;t suck anymore.</p>

<p>In other, other stuff: <a href="https://twitter.com/veveg">Veronica</a> and I love pretty
much anything outdoorsy, so hiking, biking, kayaking, etc.  But we&rsquo;re also kind
of lazy, so just being out in the sun in the garden is equally awesome.</p>

<p>Sorry if this is way too long of an about me page, if you made it this far,
thanks!  But at least I tend to find I relate more to content when I know
something about the author.  Hopefully that helps, if not, well, whatever.</p>
